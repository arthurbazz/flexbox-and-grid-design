# CSS Flexbox and Grid Layout
This is a responsive design, built with CSS Flexbox Layout, Grid Layout and Media query.  

## Description
This responsive design of a car card with CSS flexbox and a page layout with CSS grid layout.

I used Flexbox and Grid CSS layout to test my knowledge on both CSS flexbox and grid Layout based on the task given by Zuri Training Team.

The major challenge I faced was adding adding the fractional unit (fr) for a layout that spanned same columns and rows, which I was able to do after googling.
